## Features

- expose webpack and babel config.
- no `react-scripts` usage.

## Idea behind the example

To expose how a Lattice App would look without react-scripts nor other tooling.
The current example is using **webpack** with: css-loader, style-loader, file-loader, html plugin (scripts/styles injection) and webpack-dev-server for development and **Gulp** to execute task. 
**Babel** is also used to transpile the `src` folder, besides the react preset, the babel plugin for handing class properties is being used.
